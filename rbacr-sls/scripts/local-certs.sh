# Generates the local HTTPS certificate for Floci's CloudFront with mkcert,
# only when it's missing, expires within 30 days, doesn't cover every name
# below, or wasn't signed by this machine's mkcert CA (e.g. a checkout
# shared with a dev container, which has its own CA). Runs before Floci
# starts (3-floci in process-compose.yaml) or standalone.
#
# The certificate is signed by mkcert's local CA (`mkcert -CAROOT`). mkcert
# creates the CA on first use; browsers trust it only after a one-time
# `mkcert -install` (see floci/README.md). The files live in
# floci/certs/, which git ignores: never commit the key.
